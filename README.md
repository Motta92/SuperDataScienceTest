# SuperDataScienceTest

## Instructions:
- You have until July 3rd, 2017 end of the day to send us your coding test.

- Itâ€™s important that you upload this test into a GitHub repository since you should only send us the GitHub link for us to download and review.

- Since MeteorJS works with the frontend frameworks React, Angular and Blaze, we want you to develop the coding test with Blaze.

## Description of the application:
You will develop a small version of the Google Keep application. This is a notes application created by Google where you can create, delete and modify notes writing text inside of them. This test consists of creating a similar application where the functionalities that you have to develop are:

- Create user accounts. A user should be able to log in and register to the application.

- Create new notes. A user should be able to create a new note and write text into it.

- Delete existing notes. A user should be able to delete any of his notes.

-  Modify a note. A user should be able to modify the text that is inside of a note.

- A user can only modify or delete notes that he has created.

- A user can only see the notes that he has created. This means that the user must be registered and logged in the application to see his notes.

- A user can give a note a priority value. This means that a note should have a dropdown that lets you select a number from 1 to 10.

- The user should have two buttons. One that sorts the notes by creation date and another that sorts the notes by priority.
